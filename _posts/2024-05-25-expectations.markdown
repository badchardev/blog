## Expectatiions

As a side note before I start the post, I'm going to give the album I'm listening to at the time of each post so everyone can find some new tunes.
I may make a dedicated music post at some point but for now this will suffice. 

*Album of the post: Circa Survive - Juturna*


Expectation is a funny thing. It's a weight many of us are asked to bear from an early age, and it's something we all at times feel we fall short of. Our parent's parents had expectations for them. I'm sure they didn't fit the mold perfectly, yet why does this weight still not let up in crushing my chest? Perhaps it's the state of things? Of course the world is too expensive to afford for the vast majority of us. I never imagined my life being unable to afford when I thought about the future. I look at the prosperity brought upon by the generations before mine, and I revel at it. What must it had felt like to simply try harder, and get ahead through sheer determinism. Yet these are the same people whose greed has left our generation in shambles. It's very ammusing that they too would be the ones pointing the finger, as if we aren't anxiously trying to plug in their formula(s) of past to no avail. 

What drives the nail in this proverbial coffin? **Influencer Culture**

The hilariousness of some very affluent "podcast bros" telling myself, and all of you. That we simply aren't grinding hard enough. That we need to wake up at 4am. Mediocraty is something that is so accepted, it's laughable. The louder and more assanine you are, the more your voice resonates in the online space. Logic is simply falling by the wayside. Not in the Ben Shapiro owns feminists with facts and logic style of logic, but simple deductive reasoning is dying. What ever happened to you cannot trust everything you read online? We once understood this simple truth, and now it seems as a sheer memory. Have we suddenly gained 100% unexploitable truth? I thought not... This isn't particularly a post touching on the unaffordability of a post modern era, this is evident. It's more to highlight the philosophy of it all. An all out arms race to the top. Are you two feet down from me? I'll kick you down the mountain, no need for extra harnesses. It's an all out blood sport. We are lacking, and I mean strongly lacking humility. It's good news though... we don't need it when you have all of these reports due by next week! The amenities just aren't worth the price of this apartment. In contrast, I don't want them. I want to live in a world that builds its fellow human up. The problem is, this machine wasn't built for that purpose... It sure can make faked efficiency look good though! Look at all of the gears turning!

Don't mind the flames, and suffering in the belt system, our tax cuts account for that.

**I'm absolutely terrified.**
